<h1>Submarine Adventure Game</h1>

Welcome to the Submarine Adventure Game! After successfully coding the classic Snake Game, I decided to take it up a notch and implement HTML canvas to enhance the game's smoothness and overall professionalism. In this game, you take control of a submarine and navigate through the depths while avoiding enemy bullets.

<h3>Features</h3>
HTML Canvas: Implemented to provide a smoother gaming experience.
JavaScript Classes: Used classes for both the submarine and enemies to organize and streamline the code.

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
One major drawback is the limited development time. Due to time constraints, some features and enhancements were left out. Apologies for any inconveniences this may cause.

<h3>Improvements</h3>
For future development, consider the following improvements:

Increased Difficulty: Make the game more challenging to keep players engaged.
Enhanced Start and End Pages: Create a more polished and attractive introduction and conclusion for a better gaming experience.
Audio Integration: Add background music or sound effects to make the game more immersive.


I will be updating this game and completing this :)
